// each anchor the walk follows incoming `serves` edges depth-first. Children
// are ordered by createdAt (ties: graph.jsonl order), so the preorder is a stable topological
// order: every idea appears below one idea it serves. An idea reached a second
// time (it serves more than one parent) becomes a back-reference (`ref`) with
// no children. The `seen` set also makes the walk terminate on a corrupted
// graph that has a `serves` cycle.
